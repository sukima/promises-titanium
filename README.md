# Promises Titanium Example [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sukima/promises-titanium.png?branch=non_alloy)](https://travis-ci.org/sukima/promises-titanium)

An example on using promises in a Titanium application.

The `non_alloy` branch does *not* use Alloy. If you want to see examples based on alloy check out the `master` branch.

This fork by @gazialankus applies a number of changes to make it work fine in Android. The changes are: 

- To make it work in Android, broke the UI's dependency on iOS and simplified it. Also edited tiapp.xml to add Android stuff and to change default units to dp.
- To make it work in Titanium Studio, commented out the ES6Generators detection in q.js because it broke Titanium Studio debugger (Titanium does not have ES6 anyway).
- To make it work with Genymotion or an actual Android device, changed localhost to the local IP of the host machine, which the user should edit (in Resources/root_win.js:53).

Known issues in Android and Titanium Studio debugger

- In q.js there are a couple of places where exceptions are thrown intentionally. Debugger stops at them by default, and you have to hit continue. If you don't want this, uncheck Window->Preferences->Studio->JavaScript Debug->Suspend on errors.
- The fourth button (Try HTTP load (parse error)) freezes the app in Titanium Studio's debugger, as per this bug: https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-17375
- node-inspector is an alternative debugger that does not have these issues. See https://gist.github.com/ffabreti/8fd551ed321d51d7f458#comment-1393322
- Trying to run server.coffee from this directory adds the node_modules directory that shows errors in Titanium Studio. Instead, move package.json and server.coffee to a separate directory and run it from there.

## Getting Started

First make sure you have a working titanium environment. NPM will install
titanium as a dependency however, it still needs to install the SDK manually.
It is recommended you install titanium globally first.

    $ npm install -g titanium
    $ titanium sdk install 3.1.3.GA

Once ready run the following in the projects working directory.

    $ npm install .
    $ npm start             # start server and compile app OR
    $ npm run-script debug  # for verbose debug output

This will spawn a small express server for demo uses and then will build the
application and spawn it in the iOS simulator.

## How promises are used in titanium

Promises offer a convenient way to make syntactical and logical sense of the
confusing nature of asynchronous code. If your reading this then you most
likely know what the patterns are surrounding callbacks and the difficulties
they pose in code readability and consistency.

In this project I outlined three use cases where asynchronous code is used and
how promises *could* be implemented to help.

#### Timeouts / delays

`setTimeout` offers a convenient way to delay things. A sample implementation
of such a function could look like:

```JavaScript
function delayed(ms) {
  var defer = Q.defer();
  setTimeout(defer.resolve, ms);
  return defer.promise;
}

delayed(1000).then(function () {
  console.log("It finished!");
});

// Q does this for you with Q.delay()
```

A timeout loop is illustrated in `Resources/timeout_promiser.js`. This pattern
can be useful to break up long running processing into small chunks allowing
the current JavaScript context to avoid getting blocked.

#### Modal windows / controls

Sometimes user interaction is required but your only interested in a one time
result. Unlike events which are triggered more than once. Some user interaction
is one-off. For example a popup message with choices. Or a modal login screen.

An example of such a component is in `Resources/modal_popup.js`.

#### HTTP Requests

One of the most common use cases is to handle HTTP request. Several
implementation exist which convert to promises. The most basic is illustrated
in `Resources/http_client.js` which uses the Titamium.Network.HTTPClient
module.

For an example on the simplicity of making a promise based getter method that
uses Node's HTTP module (this is not Titanium but here for reference and
illustration):

```JavaScript
http = require('http');
function httpGet(url) {
  var data = "", defer = Q.defer();
  http.get(url, function (res) {
    if (res.statusCode !== 200) {
      defer.reject("Bad HTTP: " + res.statusCode);
      return;
    }
    res.on("error", defer.reject);
    res.on("data", function(chunk) { data += chunk; });
    res.on("end", function() { defer.resolve(data); });
  });
  return defer.promise;
}

// JSON: {"message":"test"}
httpGet("http://example.com/sample.json")
  .then(JSON.parse)
  .get("message")
  .then(console.log, console.log)
  .done();
```

## Tests

This project uses jasmine-node to run tests on the application. It is Node
based and therefore uses a [mocked out][mockti] version of the Titanium API.
Keeping this in mind that tests only test the behaviour of the code written
in this application and *not* the Titanium API. Which means testing that
views render correctly is out of scope with this setup.

[mockti]: https://github.com/rf/mockti

You run the tests with:

    $ npm test

The examples used illustrate how to properly handle the asynchronous nature
of promises. Synchronous assumptions in the usual tests will fail or offer
inconsistent results when promises are used and require the tests to be
written asynchronously.

#### Example specs in Jasmine

When testing promise code in [Jasmine][] you have to remember that despite
using any mock timer all methods in the [Q library][q] implementation are
asynchronous.

[Jasmine]: http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/
[q]: http://documentup.com/kriskowal/q/

The following example **WILL HAVE PROMBLEMS**:

```CoffeeScript
describe "A broken test for promises", ->
  it "should call the callback but will fail instead", ->
    callback = createSpy "callback"
    promise = functionReturnsAResolvedPromise()
    promise.then(callback)
    expect( callback ).toHaveBeenCalled()
```

The reason is that the `then` method will return immediately but not run the
callback to next tick. So when we attempt to see if the spy was called it
hasn't yet.

To fix this use an asynchronous test pattern:

```CoffeeScript
describe "A working test for promises", ->
  beforeEach ->
    @promise = functionReturnsAResolvedPromise()

  it "should call the callback", ->
    ready = false # a flag to poll for when the test can continue
    callback = createSpy "callback"
    runs ->
      # force the flag to finish execution regardles of state of promise.
      @promise.fin -> ready = true # turn the flag to true
      @promise.then(callback)
    waitsFor (-> ready), "promise to be resolved", 10
    runs ->
      expect( callback ).toHaveBeenCalled()
      # Always offer a way for unhandle exceptions to get re-thrown
      @promise.done()
```

A little but more code but now we can guarantee that when we expect the
callback to have been called the `then` method will have had a chance to
finish.

## Android Compatibility

This should work both in iOS and Android. However, to make it work in Titanium Studio's debugger in Android, we made the following change: the ES6Generators detection in q.js is commented out because it broke Titanium Studio debugger (Titanium does not have ES6 anyway).

Known issues and suggestions for Android and Titanium Studio debugger:

- In q.js there are a couple of places where exceptions are thrown intentionally. Debugger stops at them by default, and you have to hit continue. If you don't want this, uncheck Window->Preferences->Studio->JavaScript Debug->Suspend on errors.
- The fourth button (Try HTTP load (parse error)) freezes the app in debug mode as per this bug: https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-17375 . It works fine in run mode.
- node-inspector is an alternative debugger that does not have these issues. See https://gist.github.com/ffabreti/8fd551ed321d51d7f458#comment-1393322
